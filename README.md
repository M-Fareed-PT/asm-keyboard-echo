# ⌨️ x86 Assembly Keyboard Echo Program  
An x86 Assembly real-mode program that reads single keystrokes using BIOS interrupts and echoes them back to the screen.  
This project demonstrates low-level input handling and interrupt-driven programs.

---

## 🚀 Features
✔ Reads keystrokes from keyboard buffer  
✔ Uses BIOS Interrupt 16h  
✔ Echoes keys to screen in real-time  
✔ Works in 16-bit real mode  
✔ Runs on QEMU/Bochs/VirtualBox

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- BIOS interrupt usage (INT 16h, INT 10h)  
- Register-based control (AH, AL)  
- Real-mode Assembly  
- Keyboard buffer handling  
- Low-level I/O
